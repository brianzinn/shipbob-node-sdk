## Generated code
```bash
# to generate the actual TypeScript client
$ yarn generate:client
```

I've included here just a partial of what is generated.  The markdown and models.  It's a lot of code, but also it doesn't include what's not in the openapi.json file.  Anyway, this is another way to generate a client YMMV.
